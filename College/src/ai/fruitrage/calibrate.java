/**
 * You will have five (5) minutes to run calibrate.xxx. These minutes will NOT
 * come out of your time budget for the rest of the game.
 * 
 * To help you with figuring out the speed of the computer that your agent runs
 * on, you are allowed to also provide a second program called calibrate.xxx
 * (same extension conventions as for homework.xxx). This is optional.
 * 
 * If one is present, we will run your calibrate program once (and only once)
 * before we run your agent for grading.
 * 
 * You can use calibrate to, e.g., measure how long it takes to expand some
 * fixed number of search nodes. You can then save this into a single file
 * called calibration.txt in the current directory.
 * 
 * When your agent runs during grading, it could then read calibration.txt in
 * addition to reading input.txt, and use the data from calibration.txt to
 * strategize about search depth or other factors.
